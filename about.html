<td align="left"><h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Alberto Speranzon received the &ldquo;Laurea&rdquo; degree in computer engineering from University of Padova, Italy in 2000, and a Ph.D. in automatic control from the School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden in 2006. In September 2015 he joined Honeywell Labs in Minneapolis, MN, USA where he is a research scientist. At Honeywell, Alberto is part of the Advanced Technology Group, within Honeywell Aerospace, working on autonomous systems and machine learning, leading such research areas as program manager and principal investigator. He is currently also Co-PI of a DARPA sponsored project on new optimization methods based on homological algebra and sheaf theory. Before joining Honeywell, he was a research scientist at United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), in East Hartford, CT, USA where, since 2008, he covered various roles of increasing responsibility. 
At UTRC, Alberto served as project manager and principal investigator of various DARPA sponsored projects on novel methods for navigation in GPS degraded and denied and new mathematics for swarm intelligence where methods, cutting across robust adaptive filtering, artificial intelligence, graph theory and algebraic topology were combined. His research interests are mainly in the area of autonomy/robotics, machine learning and cyber– physical systems, and in particular on distributed control and optimization, analysis and design of complex systems and abstraction methods for intelligent and learning systems. Before joining UTRC, between October 2006 and September 2008, he was a Marie Curie Research Fellow at Unilever R&amp;D, Port Sunlight, UK, working on biomimetic robotics applications for personal care. During 2006–2008 he was a regular visitor at the University of California at Berkeley, working on decentralized estimation over sensor networks. Alberto received the Best Poster Award at the “Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC) conference” in 2017 and the Outstanding achievement Award in 2009 from UTRC, highest award given by UTRC. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE, an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology Journal and part of the Technical Program Committee of various conferences in the area of cyber–physical systems, robotics and networked control systems.</p>
